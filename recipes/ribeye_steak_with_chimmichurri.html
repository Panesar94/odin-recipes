        <li>Blend ingredients together until fairly smooth, depending on personal preference you can leave it a bit more chunky</li>
        <li>While pulsing/running on low slowly stream in olive oil till everthing is fully combined</li>
        <li>Taste for seasoning, if needed add more salt and pepper then transfer to a bowl and put it in the fridge to let the flavours incorporate</li>
        <li>Generously salt and pepper all sides of the steak</li>
        <li>Heat a cast iron, stainless steel or carbon steel pan on high heat, just till faint whisps of smoke appear</li>
        <li>Put approximately 1 tablespoon of avocado oil in the pan and gently let it spread out, then place the steak in the pan and slightly press it down</li>
        <li>Lower heat to medium and allow steak to develop a crust</li>
        <li>Allow steak to cook for 3 minuets before flipping and cooking another 2 minuets</li>
        <li>Flip steak onto fat side and allow it to render for about 90 seconds</li>
        <li>Add in remaining cloves of garlic and thyme along with butter and put heat on low after butter melts and foams</li>
        <li>Flip steak back down and continuosly baste steak with butter using a spoon for about 1 min</li>
        <li>Remove steak to a plate and allow to rest for five minuets to allow the juices in the steak to redistribuite,add the butter, herbs and garlic from the pan on top</li>
        <li>Once rested put steak on a warm plate and serve with the chimmichurri on the side </li>
      </ol>

      <p> And thats all there is to make an amazing steak at home! You can always try different seasonings for the steak like using differnet types of peppercorns,
        chilli peppers, and things such as granulated garlic or onion. Its important to try different things to figure out what you like and what works together!
        In addition you could also serve the steak by cutting it off the bone, slicing it against the grain and topping it with the chimmichurri.
        You can also experiment with different herbs and acids even different chilli peppers for the chimmichurri. Different acids and chillis will give different flavour profiles!
